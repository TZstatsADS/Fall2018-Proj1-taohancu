### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moments
+ This project is conducted by Tao Han

+ Project summary: This project studies what makes people happy. By researching the texts from HappyDB, we can draw the conclusion that different group of people have different happy moments. First we explore the top 10 key words which make people happy, and then we study people in different groups. We find that spending time with family can bring elder people more happiness, while having time to hang out with friend can make young people more happy. Why is that? Because elder people tend to be married.
