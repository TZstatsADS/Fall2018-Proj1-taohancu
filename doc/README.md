# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders. 

Project 1.Rmd is the code for this project. You can download and run to produce the html file.

Project 1.nb.html is the html output, though it is too large to view on Github.
